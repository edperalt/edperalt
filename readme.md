IÂ´m **Edmundo Peralta**,  a geoscientist working on Oil & Gas industry. I discovered  **R** a few years ago and became a passion. I enjoy performing data analysis, modeling and finding new workflows to enhance my work or enjoying time with my kids and our data ( see [batalla de playlist](https://github.com/edperalt/batalla_de_playlists) repo were we analyze our [spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) playlists). I will be adding a few simple workflows that usually make my daily work easier and fun.while I get better t this.
